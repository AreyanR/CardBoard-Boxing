## About the Project

This project represents my first step into game development and C# programming. The inspiration for this project came from the boxing scene found in this [YouTube clip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7rw9gqfZow&ab_channel=TheSpongeFanatic). I remember watching it as a kid and wanted to bring it to a digital world. I thought it would be a fun way to introduce myself to Unity and also serves as a milestone in my ongoing exploration of game development.


Feel free to explore the codebase. Your feedback is highly appreciated as I continue to refine and expand this project.
